PHOSPHOR is a small, dependency-light infrastructure built on one claim: a VM's actual execution, once paired with a complete **Correspondence Table System (CTS)**, is simultaneously a human-readable visualization *and* an AI-parseable event stream — not two representations of one object, but the *same* object viewed two ways.

The projection is deterministic:

> `Φ : M × CTS → V` — where `M` is the VM state at tick *t*, `CTS` is its semantic table set, and `V` is a representation that is directly readable by a human and structurally parseable by an agent.

## Two modes, one engine

```
                 VM Core (shared, UI-independent)
                /                               \
        Human mode                          AI mode
     P0 React UI (phosphor-green CRT)   Headless event stream (WS / SSE / JSONL)
        you watch it run                an agent subscribes and reasons
```

Both modes read the *same* state `M`. Human mode is the observation window; AI mode is the production surface.

## Quickstart

Requires Node.js ≥ 22.

```bash
npm install

npm run verify          # core integration (36 checks)
npm run verify:ws       # WebSocket agent server, end-to-end over a real socket (6)
npm run verify:stream   # phosphor-stream portable standard (30)
npm run verify:headless # headless AI-mode VM + EML-VM-BASIC (23)
npm run verify:eml      # v0.5 EML interop — trace consumer + Cts bridge (30)
npm run verify:semantic # v0.5 semantic layer — operational equivalence judge (26)
npm run verify:sheet    # v1.1 PHOSPHOR-SHEET workbook + real XLSX (29)
npm run verify:sheet-control # v1.2 interactive control-plane round trip (32)
npm run verify:wasm     # v0.6 real WebAssembly Φ target, cross-checked against Node's native engine (24)
npm run verify:wasm-semantic # v0.7 Phase 2 flagship flow — real-rustc equivalence judge + governed execution (17)
npm run typecheck       # tsc --noEmit, zero errors
```

Run a program headless and watch the AI-mode snapshot stream:

```bash
npm run phosphor -- run --program fibonacci --max 40
# JSONL: one VMSnapshot per tick — {mode:"ai", pc, instruction, registers, changed_this_tick, ...}
```

The human-mode UI (Vite + React, drives the verified core directly):

```bash
cd ui && npm install && npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
```

A self-contained double-click binary (no Node required) can be built with `node exe/build-exe.mjs` and is published as a **GitHub Release** asset — it is not committed to the repo.

| `eml-vm64-window.ts` | V2 window layer + 16-bit memory channels |
| `eml-vm-basic.ts` | **EML-VM-BASIC** — bounded-integer profile `[0,N]`, no mul/div, constraint engine |
| `headless-vm.ts` | `createHeadlessVM` factory + `phosphor run` CLI (AI mode), emits `vm:tick` events |
| `headless-snapshot.ts` | **v0.5** — browser-safe, single-source AI snapshot builder (shared by `headless-vm.ts` *and* the UI) |
| `eml-semantic.ts` | **v0.5** — semantic↔machine-code layer: `describeEffect` (per-instruction operational semantics) + `semanticEquiv` (three-valued equivalence judge) |
| `stream/eml-consumer.ts` | **v0.5** — ingest an EML `phosphor-jsonl-v1` trace; extract `eml:equiv`/`eml:bug`/lifecycle ([interop contract](stream/EML-INTEROP.md)) |
| `eml-cts-interop.ts` | **v0.5** — bridge EML's source-level `Cts` into PHOSPHOR-side views (dictionary / attention / loops) ([contract](CTS-INTEROP.md)) |
| `stream/` | **phosphor-stream** — a portable "state → AI-readable event stream" standard ([spec](stream/PHOSPHOR-STREAM.md)) |
| `spreadsheet/` | **PHOSPHOR-SHEET** — spreadsheet projection + governed XLSX control plane ([spec](spreadsheet/PHOSPHOR-SHEET.md)) |
| `wasm/` | **v0.6** — Φ over real WebAssembly bytecode: binary parser, functional-step interpreter, CTS mapping, headless snapshot builder (`wasm-binary.ts` / `wasm-interp.ts` / `wasm-cts.ts` / `wasm-snapshot.ts`); **v0.7** — `wasm-semantic.ts` (equivalence judge), `wasm-sheet-bridge.ts` (verdict → 09_Control row), `rust-fixtures/` (real `rustc`-compiled proposal fixtures) |
| `ui/` | Human-mode React UI (single engine = the verified core; renders the CTS live) |
| `exe/` | Node SEA packaging → a double-click `PHOSPHOR.exe` |

`eml-vm16.jsx` / `binary-matrix.jsx` are standalone single-file artifacts (reference / aesthetic prototype).

## phosphor-stream — the portable standard

The AI-mode idea generalized: any app can emit a `phosphor-jsonl-v1` event stream so an agent can see **what actually happened** instead of guessing from UI or source. Self-describing (a semantic dictionary), intent-vs-actual (`check()`), globally orderable, best-effort (never breaks the host). See [`stream/PHOSPHOR-STREAM.md`](stream/PHOSPHOR-STREAM.md).

```ts
import { createEmitter } from './stream/phosphor-stream';
import { fileSink } from './stream/sink-node';
const mon = createEmitter({ stream: 'myapp', sink: fileSink('./myapp-monitor.jsonl') });
mon.emit('agent:done', { agent: 'codex', code });   // code !== 0 is auto-flagged by findAnomalies()
```

## VM family

| VM | Address space | Value domain | ISA | Use |
|----|---------------|--------------|-----|-----|
| EML-VM-BASIC | 8-bit (256 cells) | bounded int `[0,N]` | minimal (no mul/div/logic) | cleanest AI-mode substrate |
| EML-VM-16 | 8-bit (256 B) | u8 | full 28-op ISA | prototype / teaching |
| EML-VM-64 | 16-bit (64 KB) | u8 + 16-bit AR | full V2 ISA | larger address space |
| EML-VM-F32 / F64 | TBD | float | TBD | **deferred (post-v0.5)** |

## Roadmap

**v0.7 (this release) — shipped:**

- **Phase 2 flagship case** — all three projections on one real story instead of three separate demos: an AI proposes an optimization to a **real `rustc -O`-compiled** WASM program ([`wasm/rust-fixtures/`](wasm/rust-fixtures/), not hand-assembled), [`wasm/wasm-semantic.ts`](wasm/wasm-semantic.ts) (`semanticEquiv`'s discipline ported to WASM's call/memory-region shape) judges it, the verdict is embedded in a `09_Control` row *before* a human ever reviews it ([`wasm/wasm-sheet-bridge.ts`](wasm/wasm-sheet-bridge.ts)), and `phosphor-control.ts` **hard-refuses** to execute any proposal not certified `equivalent` — regardless of the Approved column, so a human approving a bad proposal by mistake doesn't matter. [`ui/src/FlagshipView.jsx`](ui/src/FlagshipView.jsx) (▸ FLAGSHIP tab) shows it live: propose two variants (one a genuine safe optimization, one with a planted off-by-one), approve both, execute — only the certified one runs, and the Human-CRT view visibly switches to it.
- **WASM in the human UI** ([`ui/src/WasmView.jsx`](ui/src/WasmView.jsx), ▸ WASM tab): the v0.6 interpreter wired into the CRT view, browser-verified against `verify:wasm`'s own results.
- **Six themes + a settings UI** ([`ui/src/theme.jsx`](ui/src/theme.jsx)): color tokens repointed at CSS custom properties (zero changes at ~200 existing call sites) — 原版 phosphor-green, 深邃, 墨金, 米白 (the one light theme), 赤紅, 冷藍海洋 — behind a persisted `ThemeSwitcher`.
- **PET tab** ([`ui/src/PetZone.jsx`](ui/src/PetZone.jsx)): a deliberately minimal placeholder mascot — reacts to a real background WASM run (not scripted animation), voice is pre-baked static clips (`ui/scripts/generate-pet-voices.ps1`) rather than live per-user `SpeechSynthesis`, since a live voice depends on whichever TTS happens to be installed on whoever's machine runs it.

**v0.6 — shipped:**

- **Φ's first non-invented target — real WebAssembly** ([`wasm/`](wasm/)): a spec-conformant `.wasm` binary parser + a functional-step interpreter (i32 core, structured control flow, `call`, one linear memory) + a CTS mapping over the linear-memory address space + a headless snapshot builder — all the same roles VM-16/64/BASIC already fill, now over an architecture nobody had to invent. Cross-checked against Node's own native `WebAssembly` engine on the same bytes: not internal self-consistency, agreement with an independent, spec-conformant implementation.
- **PHOSPHOR-SHEET** ([`spreadsheet/`](spreadsheet/PHOSPHOR-SHEET.md)): a third formal Φ projection — Human UI / AI stream / now Spreadsheet — with a real dependency-free OOXML `.xlsx` writer/reader and a governed, untrusted command-intent control plane (draft → validated → approved → executed, idempotent terminal states). Framed as legibility and an audit trail for what an agent proposes and what a human approved — not as a containment/governance boundary; a soft approval gate cannot guarantee that against an increasingly capable model, and branding it as one would invite exactly that misplaced trust.

**Next:**

- A generalized retrofit methodology (Phase 3): the CTS six layers restated as domain-agnostic roles, an explicit determinism/observability tier system, and a guided (not fully automated) adoption path for other codebases — see `WORKPLAN.md`.
- **EML-VM-F32 / F64** float VMs — deferred (they need a float value model, IEEE-754 ISA semantics, and a float-aware CTS/snapshot; see the v0.5 spec).
- A **Hoare/denotational** proof layer on top of the operational judge.

**v0.5 — shipped:**

- **Semantic↔machine-code layer, operational form** ([`eml-semantic.ts`](eml-semantic.ts)): `describeEffect` maps each instruction to its state-transition meaning; `semanticEquiv` judges whether two byte sequences are semantically equivalent by *running both and comparing observable output* — with adversarial inputs, a ≥2-distinct-output guard, and a three-valued `equivalent` / `not-equivalent` / `inexpressible` verdict (the discipline ported from EML's execution-truth gate). A formal **Hoare-logic** proof layer is intentionally deferred.
- **EML ⇄ PHOSPHOR interop**: PHOSPHOR consumes EML's `phosphor-jsonl-v1` traces and bridges EML's source-`Cts` into machine-CTS views.
